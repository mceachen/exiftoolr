# Ruby wrapper for ExifTool

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mceachen/exiftoolr.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mceachen/exiftoolr)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/exiftoolr.png)](http://rubygems.org/gems/exiftoolr)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mceachen/exiftoolr.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mceachen/exiftoolr)

This gem is the simplest thing that could possibly work that
reads the output of [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool)
and renders it into a ruby hash, with correctly typed values and symbolized keys.

Note that this gem was renamed from 'exiftoolr' to the less-ungainly 'exiftool'
as of version 0.2.0. This gem simply adds a "class alias" from Exiftoolr to Exiftool,
and is dependant on that new gem.

Consumers should switch to the new gem's namespace as soon as possible.
